    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <p>I&E Travel Concierge ("we", "us") provides personalized travel planning, booking, and support services. Our role is to act as an intermediary between you ("the client") and third-party service providers such as airlines, hotels, and tour operators. We are responsible for the quality of our consulting and organization services, but not for the direct provision of the third-party services themselves.</p>

    <h2>2. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The client is responsible for:
        <ul>
            <li>Providing accurate and complete information regarding travel preferences, personal details, and required documents (passports, visas, etc.).</li>
            <li>Reviewing and confirming the details of all itineraries and bookings we provide.</li>
            <li>Complying with the terms and conditions of all third-party suppliers.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. Bookings and Payments</h2>
    <p>Once an itinerary is approved, we will proceed with the necessary bookings on your behalf. Payment terms, cancellation policies, and fee structures will be clearly outlined in a separate, personalized service agreement provided to you before any financial commitment is made.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>We exercise great care in selecting our partners and suppliers. However, as we act as an agent, we cannot be held liable for any errors, omissions, injuries, or damages caused by these third-party suppliers. Our liability is strictly limited to the fee paid for our concierge services.</p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. All personal information and travel plans will be handled with the utmost discretion and confidentiality, as detailed in our Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which our company is registered. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that location.</p>
